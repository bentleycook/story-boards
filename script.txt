Suddenly, {person(1)} heard a noise. “Up there!” shouted {person(2)}, spotting something.
The two friends looked up.
Unfortunately for {person(2)}, at that very moment something was falling from the sky and landed—splat!—on {person(2)}'s face!



A giant bird with bright green feathers landed softly next to them.

The goo dribbled down into {person(2)}'s mouth. {person(2)}'s expression turned from disgust to delight — “mmm, carrot cake,” {person(2)} said, now happily licking the cake off.

Around the neck of the giant green bird was a rolled up piece of paper tied with string.

{person(3)} took the paper and untied it. “It's a note!” exclaimed {person(3)}.

“To whoever finds this note —  help! I've been dognapped and locked in a castle. Please come quickly and rescue me! Taco” [pawprint]

“Someone's in trouble!” said {person(1)}. “Someone called ‘Taco’ who signed their note with a paw print.”

The green bird ducked down and seemed to be telling them to climb on.

“Maybe this bird will take us to the castle” said {person(3)}. The three friends climbed carefully onto its feathery back.

“Hang on!” said {person(2)}, “I nearly forgot my [object-1]” {person(2)} swiftly jumped down, pick up the [object-1], and clambered back on.

With two powerful beats of its wings, the giant giant bird took off into the air.

---

The would-be rescuers flew higher and higher above the ground, the bird's huge wings powerfully beating the air.
Over the houses and streets they went, the wind rushing past them.
“Look down there,” shouted {person(3)}, “I can see [place-2]! It looks so small from up here”.
“Why are all those people [activity-2]?” wondered {person(2)}.

Suddenly, the land below the {friendCount} friends disappeared, and they were flying over a great sea.
On and on the bird flew. {person(2)} held tightly onto the [object-1] so it wouldn't fall.

After what seemed like no time at all (but was actually quite a long time because the castle was far far away) a small castle appeared on the horizon.

It then became a slightly bigger castle, then a medium sized castle, until—as they got nearer and nearer—they saw that it was actually a very very big castle.

“Wow!” said {person(2)}, “look at all those towers and flags and other things you'd expect to see on a castle.”

---

The giant bird circled the castle, then came to a soft land right up in front of the drawbridge that leads to the entrance.

{joinn(this.getNames('characters'))} climbed down off the bird. {person(2)} gave it a pat and the bird wriggled with happiness, then flew off into the distance.

The {friendCount} adventurers gazed up at the giant castle looming in front of them.

---

Suddenly, a huge red dragon landed in front of them. THUD! Plumes of dust blew up around it. From the dragon's mouth came wisps of smoke. There was a strong smell of burning.

{joinn(this.getNames('characters'))} jumped back in fright.

They were feeling…
[Add cards to the feelings list.]

They were feeling [scared, etc]. How were they going to get past the dragon to the castle?

---

“The dragon looks hungry!” said {person(2)}.

“I think it wants to eat us,” said {person(1)}.

“I know — what if we give it some other food instead?” said {person(3)}.

[add pictures of food to “Food for Dragon”]

---

animate (?) food thrown to Dragon

The Dragon eats the [ham]. The Dragon eats the [fish]. The Dragon eats the [burger].

The Dragon lets out a humongous BUUUURRRRB, then it flaps its wings, lifts up into the air and flies away.

There's a quiet metalic sound on the floor.

“A coin!” says {person(3)}, stooping to look at it. “The dragon must have burped it out. I wonder if that will be useful later.”

[move the coin into your hands]

---

The {friendCount} friends run across the drawbridge towards the castle.

(see a boy sitting, weeping. He needs an (object), for I lost my one and my mother will be very unhappy with me. [Mary] gives it. Boy gives them the map.)

[move it into your hands]

---

[Map graphic]

Record turns in code.

---

{person(3)} pushes on the large wooden door to the castle. With a CREEAAK it slowly swings open, and the {friendCount} friends run in.

[navigate according to code]

[Find a coin]

---

As they turn the final corner, through the darkness they can make out a red door. “Hurray!” cries {person(2)}, relieved to have made it.

But then, from out of the shadows lumbered a massive creature. The {friendCount} friends step back into the darkness.

He was taller than two men, was green with bulging muscles and a really really ugly face. Really ugly.

“Who goes there?” he bellowed. “I smells Humans. I likes eating humans.”

“What do we do??” whispered {person(3)} urgently.

“He's a scary troll,” replied {person(2)}, “but if I know trolls — and I know trolls — the only way to beat him is to be even scarier.”

[add scary face cards — build up a wall of scary faces]

---

The troll looked at the scary faces. His face turned from anger to fear. With a little yelp like a kitten standing on a lego brick, the big fat troll ran away to hide.

A familiar tinkling sound tells us that, in his fear, the troll dropped a gold coin.

[pick up the coin?]

---

Boldly, {person(1)} walks up to the red door in front of them, takes hold of the handle and pulls. It doesn't move.


“It's locked,” says {person(1)}. “What do we do now?”

{person(2)}'s eyes adjust to the darkness. In the corner of the hallway, a shape becomes visible. It's a tall rectangular box, with a glass front and a panel of metal buttons to one side. Across the top is a sign say “Keys Vending Machine”.

“A vending machine for keys!” cries {person(2)}. “How very convenient!”

{joinn(this.getNames('characters'))} rush over to the machine. Inside are three keys, hanging on hooks. Beneath each is a small label saying, “3 gold coins”.

(if have 3 coins)
  “We only have enough to buy one key. We're just going have to choose one and hope it's the right one for this door”, says {person(3)}.
(else if <3 coins)
  “I'll run back and get that coin”, says {person(3)}.

[Put the three coins into the vending machine, then choose a key by putting a sticker on the one you want]

---

The vending machine makes a whirring sound, then the key drops down inside. Reaching into the machine, {person(3)} pulls out the key.

{person(3)} walks purposefully over to the red door, looking round to check the troll hadn't come back.

The key slid easily into the lock. With a turn of the key, the lock clicked, and the door swung open. Bright light shone from inside.

---

{joinn(this.getNames('characters'))} walked into the bright room, their eyes struggling to adjust to the light.

Over in the corner of the dusty room, lay a grey and white husky dog, gently snoring.

“Taco!” cried {person(2)}. “We're so pleased to see you!”

Taco woke up, looked at the {friendCount}, and gave a big husky smile.

“Roo!” said Taco, rushing up and licking his {friendCount} rescuers. He was excited to be free.
